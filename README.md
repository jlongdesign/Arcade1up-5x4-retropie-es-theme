# Arcade1up-5x4-retropie-es-theme
Created by Justin Case based on code by Dwayne Hurst aka Hursty

The goal of this project is to recreate the look and feel of Arcade1up's UI

There are over 300 system icons included with this theme

I've also included an Arcade1up splash screen (_inc/splashscreen/arcade1up.mp4),
a "Winners Don't Use Drugs" loading screen (_inc/launching.jpg),
and a collection of 24 slideshow/wallpapers (_inc/slideshow/images)

Shout out to all the great members of the Arcade1up modding community!
You are an inspiration to all of us!  Please continue to share your work!
